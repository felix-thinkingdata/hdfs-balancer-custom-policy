# hdfs-balancer-custom-policy

A customized balancing policy for HDFS Balancer based on a system of priorities, which can be adapted and configured according to usage demands. The priorities define whether HDFS parameters, or whether cluster topology should be considered during the operation, thus making the balancing more flexible.
